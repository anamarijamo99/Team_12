## Vision
My Open Secret (working title) is an open source privacy sensitive journalling app for logging different kinds of data.
The user can tag entries with custom tags and also create their own data fields for entries. These tags and data fields can then be used to filter and search for entries.
Data protection is important - no internet capabilities and local data is stored with encryption.
